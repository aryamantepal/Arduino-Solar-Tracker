### üåû Arduino Solar Tracker (ESP32)
This project is a dual-axis solar tracking system powered by an ESP32, which uses LDRs, servo motors, and an OLED display to automatically align a solar panel with the sun for optimal light exposure.

#### üîß Features
Dual-axis tracking using 4 LDR sensors

Smooth servo motion with light threshold and tolerance settings

OLED display showing live light sensor readings and servo positions

Buffered sensor reading for noise reduction

#### üõ† Hardware Required
ESP32 development board

4 √ó LDRs (Light Dependent Resistors)

4 √ó 10kŒ© resistors (for voltage divider with LDRs)

2 √ó Servo motors (SG90 or similar)

0.96‚Äù I2C OLED display (SSD1306 128x64)

Breadboard + jumper wires

Solar panel or mock mount for testing

#### üß† Code Logic Summary
Reads light levels from 4 LDRs placed in quadrants.

Averages top vs bottom and left vs right values.

Moves vertical/horizontal servos to minimize the light imbalance.

Updates a small OLED with sensor values and tracking status.

Ignores movement if overall brightness is too low.
